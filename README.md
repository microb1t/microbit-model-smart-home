# microbit-smart-home
This is the code repository for the code I used for the microbits to make my 'smart home.' This is a project for school that I did.

I made the project in Microsoft's MakeCode platform (https://makecode.microbit.org). I'm going to link the files somewhere, maybe I'll use the feature built in to MakeCode where you can export your code as a Github repository, and then I'll just have a link to that.
