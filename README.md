# microbit-smart-home
This is the code repository for the code I used for the microbits to make my 'smart home.' This is a project for school that I did.

I made the project in Microsoft's MakeCode platform (https://makecode.microbit.org). I'm going to link the files somewhere, maybe I'll use the feature built in to MakeCode where you can export your code as a Github repository, and then I'll just have a link to that.

## **My Adventure**

This project was a lot more than I thought it was going to be. It was a five week long project, so five days a week. Two of the weeks were only 4 school days because of Memorial Day. Plus, class periods are, on average, about 35-40 minutes long depending on wether or not we had Advisory that day. Plus, getting the materials out at the start of the period and putting them back at the end leaves about 30 minutes for working on the project. The classroom wasn't exactly the best place for concentrating on working to make the project, as there were lots of people messing around on the other side of the classroom. So if it seems like this project took way longer than it should've, it's because of the short work time per day and the destractions in the classroom.

## **Timeline**

   ### Week 1
   
   On the first week of this project I focused on building the physical model of the house and putting the lights in. To do that, I had limited materials and the wires I chose to connect to the LEDs were alligator clips on one side and the male pin on the other so I could connect them to a breadboard. The following image was the result of Week 1.

 ### Week 2
 
 On the second week of this project I focused on adding more lights to the first floor of the house and coming up with a way to use Micro:bits to control the lights remotely. I think I should mention that I made many iterations of this code. I had to make more versions of the code for many reasons- some of which being a feature that I wanted to add, some being issues with the code itself, and some being compatibility issues with the micro:bit. There was also the occasional simple screw-up on my part, which happened more times than I want to admit.
